# Basic-Weather-App
This is the Basic weather app from TOP

Requirements: 

1. Creating a weather forecast site using the weather API. What exactly should be included is left way open to interpretation. I think to start I will only include temperature, cloud condition, and the name of the city. 

2. The location has to be searchable. This isn't too hard; just do what you did for the Giphy project. Got it done.

3. Needs to toggle whether the temperature is in F or C. For this I will keep F and C values in separate lists and have the program switch between them when the button is toggled.

4. The look of the page should change based on the data.
